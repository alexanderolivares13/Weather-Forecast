## Description
- This project was created to be able to test my ability and knowledge of implementing server side APIs. Learning how to use a fetch call and utilizing the returned data to make a webpage dynamic and responsive proved to be a challenge. Overall, implementing these ideas helped better my understanding of JavaScript, dot notation, local storage, and server side APIs. This project also really aided in furthering my understanding of the numerous powerful and useful applications that can be built with server side APIs.
